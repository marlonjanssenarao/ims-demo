### Build an executable JAR

You can run the application from the command line with Maven with the following command: `mvn spring-boot:run`. Alternatively, you can build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources with `mvn  package` and then run the JAR file, as follows:

```
        java -jar ims-demo\ims-rest\target\ims-rest-1.0.0.jar
```
